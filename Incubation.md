## Subject: Fuel Your Next Wave of High-Quality Startups - Partner with DevAarambh

Hello Team,

Hope you’re doing well.

I’m reaching out with something that directly aligns with the mission of every meaningful Incubation Centre and Startup Accelerator in India - **building real startups that don’t just pitch, but sustain, scale, and create impact**.

As part of DevAarambh’s **20-city community tour + national hackathon movement**, we’re building what we believe will be the **sharpest startup funnel in the country** — ensuring hackathon projects don’t die after the event, but evolve into real companies with real potential.

### Where You Come In

We’d love your incubation centre / accelerator to:

* **Own a hackathon theme or problem statement**
* Identify ideas that truly stand out
* And if they show merit — **support, nurture, and incubate them**

The goal is simple:
To take hackathon energy and convert it into **long-term entrepreneurial outcomes**.

### Why This Is a Massive Opportunity for You

* **Access to 50,000+ serious builders, innovators, and early founders**
* A **pan-India pipeline** across Tier 1, Tier 2, and fast-emerging entrepreneurial cities
* **You define your focus:** AI, fintech, SaaS, sustainability, devtools, healthtech—anything
* **We pre-filter noise**, so what reaches you is meaningful, aligned, and genuinely high-potential
* **Zero participation cost** — this is a community-driven initiative, not a commercial program
* Strong storytelling + discovery: amplifying your **grants, programs, visibility, and success stories**

### A Very Important Impact Layer

Across India, there are thousands of **founders who never got limelight**, never discovered grant channels, and yet are somehow building, surviving, and pushing through silently.
They’re not loud on Twitter. They’re not on every podcast. But they’re solving real problems.

We are going to **bring those founders, those stories, and those ideas to your table**.

This isn’t a “student + GPT idea fest”.
This is a **professional entrepreneurship movement** targeting:

* startup-ready founders
* serious builders
* structured problem solvers
* founders ready for **SOPs, GTM thinking, market validation, and structured scaling**

### Beyond Incubation

For:

* Founders at **idea → validation** stage → **Incubation Pathway**
* Founders already building beyond early stages → **Accelerator Pathway**

There’s **something for everyone**:
Students turning founders
Early founders needing direction
Existing startups needing acceleration
Builders evolving into entrepreneurs

This doesn’t just help founders.
This strengthens **your pipeline, your visibility, and your impact footprint** across India.

We’d love to collaborate, align the program with your objectives, and together build India’s next generation of meaningful startups — powered purely by community.

Happy to connect for a detailed conversation.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
Program Director — DevAarambh
