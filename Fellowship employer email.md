## Subject: Access Curated Top Talent Across 20 Cities — Join DevAarambh Fellowship Hiring Initiative

Hello Team,

Hope you’re doing well.

As part of DevAarambh’s 20-city community tour and national hackathon movement, we’re launching a **student fellowship + talent program** designed to help organizations like yours discover **high-quality, pre-vetted tech talent** from across India.

This is a **community-backed, non-profit initiative** run by 10+ DevRels and community leaders—independent of employers or agencies—built to create meaningful opportunities for students while solving real hiring challenges for companies.

### Why This Is a Big Opportunity for You

* **Access to 20+ cities & 50,000+ builders** including Tier 1, Tier 2, and emerging tech regions
* **Your choice of focus region:** Hire exclusively from Tier 1, Tier 2, specific states, or selected campuses
* **Tailored candidate requirements:** skills, certifications, tech stacks, experience preferences—fully customizable
* **First-level screening done by us:** so you receive only relevant, top-performing candidates
* **Zero listing cost:** opportunities listed on our community platform for free
* **True community credibility:** reach candidates who are actively building, learning, shipping—not just applying

This fellowship program runs **in parallel with our Ideathon and 20-city developer tour**, enabling you to tap into motivated students, builders, and early professionals who are already pushing themselves to create impact.

Our goal is simple:
Help organizations hire smarter while giving students meaningful access to real opportunities—powered purely by community.

We’d love to partner with you, understand your hiring goals, and align this initiative with your requirements.

Happy to jump on a call to discuss in detail.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
Program Director — DevAarambh
