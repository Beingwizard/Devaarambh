###Subject: DevAarambh: 20-City India Tour + National Hackathon - Sponsorship Opportunity

Hello {Name},

Hope you’re doing great!

I’d love to share something we’re building purely for the community - DevAarambh, a community-led initiative powered by 10+ DevRels and community leaders in India. We’re launching a 20-city developer tour followed up by an offline hackathon, bringing together 50,000+ builders across colleges, startups, incubation centres, accelerators, and working professionals.

This is an independent initiative, not backed by employers or agencies. Everyone involved is contributing individually to build something meaningful for the ecosystem.

What’s in it for you?
Build and grow your Indie + Pro developer base at scale

Partner with real community leaders, not an agency project

Every incubated hackathon project = potential customer, not just a participant

Meaningful brand presence across multiple cities and ecosystem layers

Support from government + community networks

A custom GTM + community plan for the next 3-6-9 months

We want to fix the “sponsors get nothing” problem in community initiatives and ensure your investment goes beyond just marketing - towards real adoption, impact, and brand trust.

Would love to jump on a call and discuss how you can be part of DevAarambh.

Best,
{Your Name}
Program Director - DevAarambh
